This project demonstrates a thorough, from-scratch implementation of a language model inspired by the GPT architecture. Each component of the model, from the tokenization process to training, was manually developed to showcase an in-depth understanding of transformer architectures and modern NLP techniques. By building all elements without relying on high-level libraries or pre-trained models, this project reflects a strong grasp of the mathematical foundations, model architecture, and engineering practices behind language models. Here’s an overview of the major components:

Key Components
Custom Tokenization

Developed a custom tokenizer to convert raw text data into tokens, handling tokenization and vocabulary building from scratch. This component provides a flexible framework for encoding inputs suited specifically to this model.
Positional Encoding

Implemented positional encoding to allow the model to capture sequential information. This is crucial for transformers, which lack an inherent sense of token order. The positional encodings were designed and incorporated into the embeddings to support the model's comprehension of token position.
Self-Attention Mechanisms

Self-Attention without Weights: Created a simplified version of self-attention to understand token relationships without relying on trainable weights.
Self-Attention with Weights: Introduced weighted self-attention, applying query, key, and value matrices to learn nuanced dependencies between tokens.
Causal (Masked) Attention: Developed a causal attention mechanism to ensure that each token attends only to previous tokens, enabling the autoregressive nature of the model.
Multi-Head Attention

Constructed multi-head attention by combining multiple self-attention layers to allow the model to attend to different parts of the sequence simultaneously. This setup enhances the model’s ability to capture diverse relationships in the data across different attention heads.
Feed-Forward Network (FFN)

Implemented a fully-connected feed-forward network as part of each transformer block, including ReLU activations and layer normalization for improved stability and performance. This component is essential for introducing non-linearity into the model and enhancing its representational power.
Layer Normalization and Residual Connections

Added layer normalization and residual connections around each sub-layer (attention and feed-forward) to facilitate stable training and faster convergence, reflecting a solid understanding of transformer model training dynamics.
Training Pipeline and Optimization

Built a complete training pipeline, including batching, forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimization. The training loop was designed to manage resources efficiently while ensuring effective learning, with periodic evaluation to monitor performance.
Project Highlights
This project goes beyond merely implementing a language model by deeply exploring each part of the GPT architecture. Each function was crafted and fine-tuned independently, ensuring a clear and comprehensive understanding of transformers and the underlying math. By manually implementing and integrating all major components, this project highlights an ability to design, build, and optimize language models from the ground up.
