This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of a language model (LLM) from the ground up, demonstrating a strong understanding of core NLP concepts and model architectures. Unlike using pre-built models or libraries, every component of the language model, from tokenization to the final training, was created manually, highlighting advanced technical knowledge and hands-on skills in deep learning. Key elements of this project include:

Custom Tokenizer: Built a tokenizer from scratch to process and encode the raw text data, allowing flexible tokenization strategies tailored to the model.
GPT-style Architecture: Designed a generative pre-trained transformer architecture, complete with all essential components, to produce high-quality text predictions.
Multi-Head Attention Mechanism: Implemented the multi-head self-attention mechanism, a critical feature of transformer models, to enable parallel attention across multiple heads, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies.
Training Pipeline: Developed a full training pipeline, including data preprocessing, batching, forward and backward propagation, and optimization, ensuring a hands-on approach to the entire model-building lifecycle.
This project reflects a deep understanding of advanced NLP and transformer models, illustrating not only the theoretical knowledge but also the practical ability to implement sophisticated language models from scratch. This end-to-end approach demonstrates my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing fundamentals, along with a commitment to building models that are interpretable, customizable, and efficient.
